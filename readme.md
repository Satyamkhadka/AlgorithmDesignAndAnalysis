## Framework
- Algorithm Design framework: 
    - Analyse and Solve problem
    - Choose data structure and algorithm design strategy
    - Describle the algorithm 
    - Prove algorithm correctness
    - Algorithm analysis
- Recursion Framework:
    - outline algorithm
    - key steps
    - stopping rule
    - check terminanation
    - draw recursion tree
